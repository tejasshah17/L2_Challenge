L2 Coding Challenge BestBuy

L2 is interested in benchmarking the search visibility of prominent television brands on bestbuy.com. Your challenge is to create an automated data collection tool that will
collect daily snapshots of data and yield a data set.

This project is building an automated tool that fetches the search results from the BestBuy API and extracts the necessary information to give a CSV format file. We use BestBuy's Product API to fetch the day-to-day results. The application renders anayltical data on the front end built using Python Flask.
